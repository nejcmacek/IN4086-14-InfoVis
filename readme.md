2. Copy the downloaded files to the `backend/flight_data/` directory (if the directory does not exist, create it.).
3. Run the backend server.
   1. Open console and navigate to `backend/` directory.
   2. Run `python server.py`.
4. Run the frontend.
   1. Start a HTTP server serving from the `frontend/` directory. Several options exist, see below.
