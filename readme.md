- backend part in the `backend` directory
- miscellaneous scripts that assisted us in the making of the project in separate subdirectories of the `scripts` directory

## Running the Project

Please follow the following steps in order to run the project.

1. This project requires flight data. Make sure to download the `Flights.zip` file from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K83JEqc4NDyP7nkPz0KM2yULhgUVRHx4).
2. Extract the content of the downloaded file into the the `backend/flight_data/` directory (if the directory does not exist, create it.).
3. Run the backend server. (See [backend/readme.md](backend/readme.md) for more details.)
   1. Open console and navigate to `backend/` directory.
   2. Install Python dependencies (packets `flask`, `flask-restful`, and `pandas`).
   3. Run `python server.py`.
4. Run the frontend.
   1. Start a HTTP server serving from the `frontend/` directory. Several options exist, see below.
   2. Open `index.html` in the hosted server.

### Running the Frontend

Described here are two options. The first with Python, the second with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure to have the tools installed before proceeding.

#### Running the Frontend With Python

1. Open console and navigate to `frontend/` directory.
2. Run `python -m http.server --cgi 8080`.
3. Open the browser at http://localhost:8080/.
   
	 
#### Running the Frontend with Node.js

1. Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. (Check this by running `node --version`).
2. Install the `http-server` npm package by running `npm install -g http-server`
3. Open console and navigate to `frontend/` directory.
4. Run `http-server`.
