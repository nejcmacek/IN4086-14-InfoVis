# Airport Codes

This script is used to extract all the airports. It also allows for filtering all the data that we do not need.

The main result if the `airports-50states.json` file, which contains airport data for relevant airports. Other files named `airports-[filter].json` contains a list of airports of a specific region of the whole database. 

Note that some airports have been excluded:
- those scattered in the pacific ocean (state code TT)
- those in Puerto Rico (state code PR)
- those in Virginia Islands (state code VI)
